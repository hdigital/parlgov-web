Hence, this is the country were we have most expertise and that we keep updated as a reference country for the coding. Therefore, we have added the new cabinet just at the day when Angela Merkel was re-elected as chancellor in the German Bundestag.

In ParlGov, some countries are coded at the vote level others at the seat level only. For the former, we have recorded the official election results for all parties with more than 0.5% of the vote share and turnout data is included in the coding of these countries. For seat level data, we collect only the number of seats and the percentage of votes but plan to add vote level data at some later stage.

107,Swiss cabinets added,hd,40,We have added all Swiss cabinets into ParlGov. Determining a cabinet for Switzerland according to the [four criteria](http://wiki.parlgov.org/wiki/DocCabinet#Cabinetdefinition) defining a cabinet was a little difficult. We decided not to code a prime minister in the case of Switzerland so that we have one cabinet for every legislative term that ends with an election.,2010-08-31,47
115,ParlGov II -- new web design,hd,,"The next version of ParlGov will include a new web design and we have worked with Jens Hoffmeister from [underline webdesign](http://webdesign-underline.de/) over the last months to give our website a fresh look. Here is an [example](http://www.parlgov.org/misc/parlgov-new.html) of the new design.

The old design with the current layout, logo and colors has not changed over the last five years and there were only some improvements to the navigation. Honestly, it was in strong need of a fresh look. Jens has created the new design by defining a modern layout, color scheme and logo based on the existing pages. The structure of the pages will remain but some of the underlying html and css code has been significantly cleaned up.

Ones we have put up online a first beta version of the next release you will see how fresh and modern the new design is.

108,Latvia with votes level data,hd,55,"We have updated, revised and extended all election results for Latvia and code now all parties with more than 0.5% of the national vote share. Previously, we found some mistakes in the Latvian election results and decided to add all official results. ",2010-09-19,49
109,ParlGov II -- database refactoring,hd,,"The second major change for the next ParlGov version will be a major refactoring of our database design. The causes for the need to refactor the structure of our database are similar to the previously described plans to relaunch the web design. Some of the fundamental design decisions were made at the early stages of the project and limit its growth now. Over time, our experience and technical expertise has grown and we are convinced that the benefits of a redesign outweigh the (transformation) costs.

Most fundamental will be the overhaul of all IDs. In the next version or ParlGov, there will be newly defined identifiers for all observations, most importantly for countries, parties, elections and cabinets. Previously, we had unique identifiers per country only and some of the ID variables were based on other observations and contained meaningful information. We will change that to a system of IDs were all identifiers are unique for every variable and are just numerical identifiers without containing other information. In database terminology, we are moving from a system of composite (natural) primary keys to (surrogate) primary keys.

There will also be a clean-up for some table and variable names and the new names are often more explicit than the previously used shortened versions.  In addition, we are changing from camel case VariableNames to underscore variable_names. Finally, there are some updates on the table structure.

These modifications require users of ParlGov to  update the scripts they have written to work with ParlGov data. We are convinced that it will be for the better. The new database design is easier to understand and allows us to integrate innovative aspects into future versions more easily.

107,Sweden election results and government added,hd,35,"Yesterday (5 October) was an interesting day for students of cabinet formation. The Swedish prime minister presented his new minority cabinet after failing to enlarge his coalition. In the Netherlands, the Christian Democrats party group approved the formation of a new and highly controversial minority government supported by Geert Wilders Freedom Party. In Belgium, coalition talks on government formation have collapsed on the same day.

We have included the results of the recent elections in Sweden and the new cabinet. We will add the new Dutch government as soon as it is appointed.

The election took place in August and a dramatic process of government formation followed. Nevertheless, the official election results have only been presented recently.

We have added the Australian election and the new minority cabinet to ParlGov.",2010-10-08,52
108,Belgium with votes level data,hd,64,"Today (12 October), we finished adding all votes level data for Belgium. For the country, there is a good [official source](http://www.ibzdgip.fgov.be/result/selectlanguage.php) with the results of all national and European Parliament elections and most of our updated information is from this source. Nevertheless, coding the Belgium parties is always a challenge especially for the 1970s. We did our best to link all existing parties. Nevertheless some enhancements may be suggested by country experts later on.

With ""votes level data"" we cover all parties that gained more than 0.5 percentage of the votes in post-war national and EP elections. It is our long term goal to move from ""seats level data"" to ""votes level data"" for all OECD/EU countries in the post-war period.  Only the latter level allows to use ParlGov as a device for research and teaching about electoral systems.",2010-10-12,53

For ParlGov, our time at the [European University Institute (EUI)](http://www.eui.eu/) and the [University of Heidelberg](http://www.uni-heidelberg.de/index_e.html) has been very productive. It was the academic year when we released the first public version of the projects and both institutions have provided significant support in finding out how ParlGov is received.

115,New web design and refactored database launched,hd,,"We have just put online the implementation of our new web design and the refactored database schema.

Implementing the **new design**, developed by Jens Hoffmeister from [underline webdesign](http://www.webdesign-underline.de/), has kept us busy for the last three months. In addition to applying the new layout, we have used the opportunity to significantly clean up the structure of our html templates. The web design has already been very well received by some of our colleagues who gave their views on the new layout. The structure of the page remains more or less the same. However most links have changed and we are making now use of more explicit naming conventions to define our URLs.

Converting the old **database** structure into the new schema has been an even bigger challenge. While working with the first release, we realised that many of the table and variable names were not explicit enough. In addition, we had planned to redesign some of the table structures and revise table and variable names.  There is an [earlier news](#50) entry that gives the bigger perspective on the changes to the database. *Please remember, most IDs, table names and variable names have changed in the new version.*

The **next release, ParlGov 10/11,** will follow shortly. The plan is to have a beta version out tomorrow or the day after. We will test the beta version and the new development version for some days and plan to have a release of the new version at the beginning of next week.

107,Slovenia - another cabinet composition change,hd,60,"There has been another change in the party composition of the Slovenian government when Zares ministers resigned on 27 June. We have added this change by recoding the start date of the [Pahor II](http://dev.parlgov.org/data/svn/cabinet-party/2011-06-27/) cabinet.

This particular recoding highlights one of the cabinet coding rules we have developed. Cabinet terminations as defined by political scientists (election, change party or pm, cabinet resignation) are sometimes followed by additional events that would define a new cabinet.  This may lead to defining some rather short lived (mostly technical) cabinets. We deal with the issue through a ‘three month rule’ and code continuation governments only if they last for more than three month. The [cabinet documentation](http://wiki.parlgov.org/wiki/DocCabinet) gives some more detailed information and examples.

We have tried to include all relevant information about electoral alliances and links between parties. Nevertheless, the coding of alliances and party changes may need an external validation by another country expert in the future.

There was a bug in the scripts that converted the data from Benoit/Laver and not all positions from the data set were included into the calculation. We became aware of the issue, when someone pointed out the extremely moderate left/right position of the German far-right NPD in ParlGov. We have now solved the issue and include data on all relevant dimensions from Benoit/Laver into the calculation. This also solves the issue of having information in the left/right dimension for some minor parties instead of using the state/market dimension.

While updating the position data we have also renamed the variables for the EU dimension from ‘eu_pro_contra’ into ‘eu_anti_pro’ since lower values on the scale present eurosceptic positions.",2012-05-01,94

We have learned that many of the parties below the 1.0% threshold run only in one election and it was difficult to gather reliable information about these parties.

We are almost there with only some OECD countries and a few election results (EU members) of parties that won no seats missing. However, the documentation still leaves room for improvement and there need to be some more routines that check for data consistency.

Currently, we are completing a new version of the webpage and are cleaning up the code that runs the page and calculates the data. There has been a lot of cruft over the years and often new tools provide more straight forward solutions. ParlGov needs some streamlining to be maintainable for the years to come.

We trim down on our earlier aspirations and are removing all countries that are neither EU nor OECD members. This affects data in the experimental version only. There will also be some changes to the linking of political parties.

We will provide news entries once we have completed  the respective clean-ups.

Again, none of this should effect information in the development version of ParlGov but only additional data in the experimental version (guest login required).

The ParlGov project is active and alive. Currently, we are adding the data for the first half of 2021.

Here, we will provide project news and updates of the data.

In September 2021, our long term hosting of the dynamic web page ended. Unfortunately, we were not able to migrate the page — _see details below_.

_Background_

Our hosting at [webfaction.com](https://www.webfaction.com/) ended on 15. September 2021 when the Webfaction platform was switched off.

We were hosting different versions of ParlGov at Webfaction since 2007. Thanks Webfaction!

However, our Python/Django implementation has become rather idiosyncratic over the years.

So when the service at Webfaction ended, we had to decide about the future of the dynamic page. Unfortunately, at this point we are convinced that we can not provide a robust and secure public version of the dynamic page. That is why we have decided to use this static page for now.

We have an internal workflow to work with the old implementation of the page to update the database. However, the Web, Python and Django have evolved. The codebase of the ParlGov dynamic page has not and that's why we have made this difficult decision.",2021-09-15,348
