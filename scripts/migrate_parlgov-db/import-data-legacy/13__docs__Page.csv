party,2024-08-12 10:59:19.927745,codebook,"# Parties

## Coding rules

We include parties winning _more than 1.0% vote share_ in elections we cover

Details

* winning 2 seats in an election (eg. member of an electoral alliance)
* party groups that form in parliament
    - more than 5.0% seat share (eg. [ITA FLI](http://www.parlgov.org/explore/ita/party/1477/))
    - forming in two parliamentary terms (eg. [FRA GDR](http://www.parlgov.org/explore/FRA/party/2272/))
    - members of cabinet (eg. [SWE NP-AV](http://www.parlgov.org/explore/swe/party/2608/))
    - providing minority support to a cabinet
* electoral alliances and members with at least 2 election results
* no party affiliation
    - candidates with more than 1.0% vote share (eg. [IRL I-TJM](/explore/IRL/party/2327/))
    - includes 'independent' (also for presidents)
    - one 'no party affiliation' included per country
* less than 1.0% vote share
    - winning 1 seat in 2 elections
    - 2 election results as largest party no seats (first loser)
* special categories: 'no-seat' and 'one-seat' (see [election](/documentation/codebook/#election))

We avoid including minor parties or candidates that win a seat only in one election due to low threshold requirements.


## Party change

New parties are coded in two tables: [party change](/data/table/party_change/) and [party name change](/data/table/party_name_change/).

Mergers and party splits are only added as a new party if the (largest) predecessor party won less than 75% of the combined vote of all preceding parties in the last election. Otherwise the largest party is just renamed (cf. Döring 2016, 539).

Details

* splits and re-mergers coded for original party (eg. [JPN DP](/explore/jpn/party/439/))
* see also Barnea/Rahat (2011, 311): 'a new label and that no more than half of its top candidates (top of candidate list or safe districts) originate from a single former party'


## Party names

Party names are sentence case if no national (language) convention requires title case.

* eg. party names for Germany are title case (German and English)

Party names and delimiters

* '–' different languages
* '/' ('+') alliances
* '|' generic names
* [ space before and after delimiter ]

Year added to smaller party name if identical names exist in a country (eg. [ SVK SZ-92](http://www.parlgov.org/explore/svk/party/2235/)).


## Party positions

We provide aggregated party positions in four major dimensions. These positions are time-invariant unweighted mean values of information from party expert surveys on a 0 to 10 scale. All expert surveys are linked with ids from the [party](/data/table/party/) table and original values are rescaled before calculating the mean.

Missing party positions for each dimension are imputed by mean values for the respective party family. We distinguish mean and imputed values by the number of decimal places. Mean values based on external datasets have five decimal places and imputed values have one decimal place only.

Variables and sources

* left/right — Castles/Mair 1983 (_left/right_), Huber/Inglehart 1995 (_left/right_), Benoit/Laver 2006 – (_left/right_), CHES 2010 (_lrgen_ 1999 and 2002 and 2006)
* state/market — Benoit/Laver 2006 (_taxes/spending_), CHES 2010 (_lrecon_ 1999 and 2002 and 2006)
* liberty/authority — Benoit/Laver 2006 (_social_), CHES 2010 (_galtan_ 1999 and 2002 and 2006)
* EU anti/pro — Ray 1999 (_pos96_), Benoit/Laver 2006 (_euauthority_ or _eulargerstronger_ or _eujoining_), CHES 2010 (_position_ 1999 and 2002 and 2006)


## Party families

We classify parties into families by their position in an economic (state/market) and a cultural (liberty/authority) left/right dimension.

The classification leads to eight party family categories: Communist/Socialist, Green/Ecologist, Social democracy, Liberal, Christian democracy, Agrarian, Conservative, Right-wing.

Parties that can not be classified into the eight categories are coded as 'spec' in the [party](/data/table/view_party/) table with more details in the [party family](/data/table/party_family/) table (e.g. [AUT Martin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans-Peter_Martin%27s_List)). These are mainly special issue parties without a clear left/right profile.

We use one classification for the entire history of a party and do not record changes (e.g. [FIN SP|P](http://www.parlgov.org/explore/FIN/party/200)).

We add further information about party families in a separate table (see [party family](/data/table/party_family/)).

election,2024-08-12 10:59:18.201429,codebook,"# Elections

## Coding rules

We include election results for

1. all parties that won _1.0% vote share_
2. all parties that won _2 seats_ (esp. alliance members)

Details

* a party that won _less than 1.0%_ vote share and _1 seat_
    - several election results — included into the list of ParlGov parties
    - single election result — coded as a 'one-seat' party (eg. [Poland](http://parlgov.org/explore/pol/election/1991-10-27/))
* a party that won _less than 1.0%_ vote share but was the _largest party that won no seats_ (first loser)
    - several election results — included into the list of ParlGov parties
    - single election result — coded as a 'no-seat' party (eg. [Austria](http://parlgov.org/explore/aut/party/2055/))
* parliamentary party groups – _see below_
    - party group seat compositions different to election results
    - significant changes in the composition of party groups (more than 5.0% seat share)
* mixed-member electoral systems
    - proportional (PR) tier _votes_ and _vote share_ recorded
* technical party ""others""
    - only number of seats coded


## Electoral alliances

Electoral alliances are coded by linking election results (variable 'alliance_id ') of alliance members to an alliance or the strongest party in an electoral alliance.

* each electoral alliance or alliance member coded as an individual party should include _2 elections_
* members of alliances with a dominant party are coded to this party
* alliances of parties that are part of a broader alliance are coded with a 'data_json' entry 'alliance_alliance_id' (eg. [Italy 1996](http://parlgov.org/explore/ita/election/1996-04-21))
* _votes_ are coded at the level of electoral results for all alliance members
* _seats_ are coded for alliance members (parliamentary groups), if feasible
    - seats of an alliance that forms a parliamentary group with members running independently are coded for alliance members and with a 'parliament change' (eg. Germany [CDU/CSU](http://www.parlgov.org/explore/DEU/party/1727/))
     - seats of alliance members are coded if no information about the parliamentary party group status is available
     - a 'data_json' entry 'seats_alliance' is added to the alliance to check data consistency
     - a 'one seat' party which is part of an electoral alliance is coded as an alliance member (eg. [Hungary 2014](http://parlgov.org/explore/hun/election/2014-04-06/))


## Parliament composition

- changes (> 5%) in seats composition are recorded in 'parliament change'
    + esp. if changes affect cabinet majority support
- seats composition of parliament at a particular date is recorded in 'parliament composition'
    + esp. if composition is relevant for cabinet formation (eg. [JPN elections](http://www.parlgov.org/explore/jpn/election/1996-10-20/) after 1996)
- _coding incomplete_
    + significant changes only
    + lack of systematic and reliable sources

## Coding rules

We record a new cabinet for these events (cf. Budge/Keman 1993: 10)

1. any change of parties with cabinet membership
2. any change of the prime minister
3. any general election

All parties with ministers in cabinet are included (Indridason/Bowler 2014: 396)

1. right to attend cabinet meetings
2. right to cast vote before cabinet (if applicable)

Details

* three month rule
    - a continuation (caretaker) cabinet (subset of previous coalition, no new party) is coded once for any change lasting longer than three months
    - the three month rule refers to the exact day of the date, not the number of days
    - 'data_json' entry 'three_month_rule' (and 'cabinet_change')
    - see also examples section below
* any meaningful investiture procedure defines a new cabinet
    - a PM appointment without a cabinet appointment (eg. [ITA Andreotti I](/explore/ita/cabinet/1972-02-17/), [POL Pawlak I](/explore/pol/cabinet/1992-06-05/))
    - a constitutionally required new investiture during a parliamentary term (eg. LTU Skvernelis [II](/explore/LTU/cabinet/2017-10-19/)+[III](/explore/LTU/cabinet/2019-08-20/), see [LTU notes](/documentation/country/#ltu))
* any meaningful resignation defines a new cabinet
    - a formal resignation request (eg. [AUT Figl III](/explore/aut/cabinet/1949-11-08/))
    - a successful dissolution request under negative parliamentarism (eg. [SWE Erlander VII](/explore/swe/cabinet/1958-06-01/))
    - a lost vote of confidence (or early election vote) and change to caretaker status (eg. [SVK Radicova II](/explore/svk/cabinet/2011-10-20/), [ISR Netanyahu II 1998](/explore/isr/cabinet/1998-01-04/))
* first appointment event coded
    - successive appointments for one cabinet (e.g. [DNK Thorning-Schmidt I](/explore/dnk/cabinet/2011-10-02/)
    - e.g. appointments of PM, cabinet, ministers
* cabinet parties not included
    - ministers without portfolio, interim or junior ministers
    - cabinet members without party affiliation (party family 'none') are only coded if the prime minister has no party affiliation (e.g. [DEU Papen I](/explore/deu/cabinet/1932-06-02/))
    - parties supporting a (minority) cabinet are included in table [cabinet support](/data/table/cabinet_support/) — if information available
* splits and mergers of cabinet parties
    - coded as cabinet changes (eg. [AUS Schuessel III](/explore/aut/cabinet/2003-02-28/), [CZE Klaus II](/explore/cze/cabinet/1993-01-01/))
     - 'data_json' entry 'party_split' and 'party_merger'
* parliamentary groups and alliances
    - political parties are coded as parliamentary groups (eg. [DEU CDU/CSU](/explore/DEU/party/1727/))
    - alliance members that join a parliamentary group are coded as support parties (eg. [POL Szydlo](/explore/pol/cabinet/2015-11-16/) 2015)
* seats at cabinet formation date
    - not coded for each instance of cabinet formation
    - calculated based on
        1. [election result](/data/table/election_result/) _or_ [parliament compositiion](/data/table/parliament_composition/) table – most recent date used
        2. [parliament change](/data/table/parliament_change/) table entries after (1)
    - used in [view cabinet](/data/table/view_cabinet/) and stored in [viewcalc parliament composition](/data/table/viewcalc_parliament_composition/)
    - see Müller and Strom (2000), Bergman ea. (2019) and [ERDDA](erdda.org) for exact seats at cabinet formation
* duplicate prime minister names
    - first letter of first name added to PMs with the same last name (e.g. [DNK Rasmussen N](/explore/DNK/cabinet/))
* country specific
    - Switzerland: changes in the identity of the President of the Swiss Confederation (Bundespräsident) do not define a new cabinet (cf. Kriesi/Trechsel 2008, 75-76)
    - Iceland: two [prime ministers](/explore/ISL/cabinet/1963-11-14/) named Bjarni Benediktsson (born 1908 and 1970)

Examples

* three month constraint
    - [POL Kaczynski](/explore/pol/cabinet/2006-07-14/) (2006) — coded as one cabinet
        + SRP withdraws from cabinet on 22 September 2006 (party composition change) and re-enters on 16 October
        + SRP and LPR dismissal on 13 August 2007 (party composition change) — elections take place on 19 October 2007 (within three months)
    - [BEL Leterme III](/explore/bel/cabinet/2010-06-13/) (2010) — coded as one cabinet (three month constraint)
        + Previous coalition collapses on 26 April 2010 (party composition change) — new elections on 13 June. Pre-election caretaker cabinets lasts for less and post-election cabinet for more than three months.
    - further examples: [AUT Gorbach II](/explore/aut/cabinet/1962-11-18/) (1962), [NLD Balkenende V](/explore/nld/cabinet/2010-02-23/) (2010)

Damgaard (1994: 194-95) and Müller/Strom (2000: 12) provide a more comprehensive discussion of cabinet definitions.


## Caretaker

Cabinets with a limited legislative mandate (cf. McDonnell/Valbruzzi 2014, 664)

* non-partisan: cabinet members without partisan affiliation
* provisional: appointed post-transition cabinet
* technical: institutional reasons
* continuation: remaining in office (see 'three month rule' above)
    + resignation of PM or cabinet
    + dissolution of parliament
    + after election until new cabinet forms


## Cabinet type

Cabinet status (minority, minimum winning or surplus majority) is determined only by the seat share of cabinet parties in parliament and not coded manually.

If there is an electoral alliance with separate seat shares but one of the parties is not a cabinet member, the cabinet will be treated as a minority cabinet (eg. UK 1951). Similarly, if any of the governing parties can be removed and the other governing parties still hold a majority in parliament, the cabinet is considered to be a surplus majority cabinet.


## Cabinet termination

_Experimental version only_ — coding incomplete

The events that define a new cabinet are used to define the termination date. Cabinets may remain in office for a short period after the initial terminal event. The 'description' gives a short description of eventsthat led to the end of a cabinet.


## Confidence votes

_Experimental version only_ — coding incomplete

Confidence votes are added for all recent cabinets but are not included for all cabinets in ParlGov.

* investiture (confidence) votes for new cabinets
* confidence votes that lead to the termination of a cabinet
* important (won) confidence votes.

Details

* cabinet description includes a brief entry for a confidence vote
* constructive vote of no confidence
    + coded for outgoing cabinet (eg. [DEU Schmitt III](/explore/deu/cabinet/1980-11-05/), [ESP Rajoy IV](/explore/ESP/cabinet/2016-10-29/))


## Presidents

Party-affiliated heads of state but not short-term acting presidents. See table [president](/data/table/politician_president/).


## Data sources

For new cabinets and revisions of observations, we derive information about cabinet termination from news sources, preferably from the news agencies Reuters, AFP or the main national news agency

For West European countries we double checked our initial observations with the data in Müller/Strom (2000). For Central- and Eastern European countries we compared our information to Müller-Rommel ea. (2008).

Coding comments

- Barber (2008) distinguishes the number of eligible voters between 'enrolled' and 'enrolled divisions'. Enrolled figures represent the total number of eligible voters, while enrolled division figures include only eligible voters in contested districts. The distinction applies to elections between 1901 and 1943.

# Overview

We include elections and cabinets in _established democracies_. More specifically, we include democratic national lower house elections and EP elections for _all EU and most OECD members_. For the latter, we exclude presidential systems. We record all elections and succeeding cabinets after 1945 or after full democratization according to Boix ea. (2013).

We also include elections and cabinets before 1945. We record information after 1900 or after the last democratic transition (Boix ea. 2013). As of today, these observations are experimental and may need revision (e.g. largest party with no seats missing).
